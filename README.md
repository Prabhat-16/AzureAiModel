This project involves deploying a Large Language Model (LLM) on Azure with a React-based web application for interaction. The model is hosted using Azure services to ensure scalability, security, and performance.

Features

React Web Application for user-friendly interaction

Hosted on Azure App Services for seamless deployment

Utilizes Azure Machine Learning for model management

Integrated with Azure Functions for serverless execution

Secured using Azure Active Directory (AAD)

Supports REST API for easy integration with applications

Prerequisites

An Azure account

Azure CLI installed on your local machine

Node.js and npm for React development

Azure Machine Learning SDK (if applicable)

Deployment Steps

Setup Azure Resources:

Create a Resource Group

Create an Azure App Service

Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace

Model Deployment:

Train or fine-tune your LLM (if necessary)

Register the model in Azure ML Model Registry

Deploy the model using Azure App Services or Azure Functions

React Web Application Deployment:

Build the React app using npm run build

Deploy the build folder to Azure App Service

Connect the frontend to the LLM API endpoint

Configure API Endpoints:

Expose the model as a REST API

Enable authentication using Azure AD

Testing & Monitoring:

Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights for tracking performance

Debug and optimize for scalability

Usage

Access the React Web App hosted on Azure.

Authenticate using Azure AD (if enabled).

Enter text in the UI and submit queries to the LLM.

The response will be displayed on the frontend.
